I have shared a folder with you via dropbox ***\[bcifiles\]***. It includes:

-      BCI elevation data

-      BCI 2005 and 2010 stem data

-      BCI 2005 and 2010 tree data

-      BCI species file

-      wood density file, which contains some errors, and will be updated

    soon. However the values for BCI should be fine.

-      a text file with the habitats per 20x20m quadrats, which were

    determined by observation.

However, habitats can also be determined by the slope, convexity, and elevation. I am attaching a file I made ***\[bci.quad.info.rdata\]***, which is quite old. You may want to redo this file, or maybe someone else has a better one.

The tree and stem data are the most updated ones that we have from Rick. Please use a subset of this data only.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Suzanne
