# bciex


[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/bciex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/bciex)



## Overview

The goal of bciex is to make it easy to access data for examples.



## Installation

You can install bciex from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/bciex", auth_token = "abc")
```



## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bciex)

# Mini dataset of 1000 randomly selected trees from BCI; data realeased in 2012
str(bci12t1mini)

# The stem data corresponding to the 1000 trees above.
str(bci12s7mini)
```
